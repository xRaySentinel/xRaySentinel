- 👋 I am @xRaySentinel : the corridors of the galactic trenches 
released the mega beasts. It has been up to me to 
determine the course of action like in an rts. 
With my special Superman X-Ray vision I scan the
battlefields for solutions. May God have mercy on my soul. 
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, nature, cyber security, technical support, and being a ninja. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of languages, really. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much whatever I can do to help a team with my skills. 
- 📫 Contact me here please.
